Modifier in java
---------------------
public private and default(package level)

class level - public, default, abstract, final, staticfp

class is declared public - the visibility of the class is global.
we can acess the class within the package or outside the package. (Entire Application)

class is declared no modifier(default/package level) - the visibility of the class is only within the package where it is declared.
we can't acess the class outside the package.

class is declared abstract -> when you don't want to create an object of the class.

class is declared final -> when you don't want to make the class as child.


-- Data Member Modifier ---
Data Member modifier - private, default, public, protected, static, final, volatile

if a data member of a class is declared private,then  visibility of the data member is only within the declared class.

highly recomended by java
Data Member - variable - private
Data Member - services/methods - public
